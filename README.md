# Github_Export_Utility

This simple React app allows users to readonly comments and issue details but the bes thing it can do is export to a simple table that can be used for change logs. I had beed searching for this type of app but couldn't find it so this is my first React App ever and it works.

Let me know if you think it needs improvements.

You will need a GitHub Personal Access Token and and then get the organisation name you want to report on from there run NPM install and then NPM start. You will be asked to enter in the details, from there you will be able to create a simple export that contains the issues in a table format to use in a change log from each Repo in the Organisation.
